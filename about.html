                Tic-Tac-Toe is a two player game where each player chooses a set of game pieces.
                <br>
                The first player places their piece in a square and the second one does the same and they each take turn filling in the 3x3 grid.

            <p>
                If a player gets their game pieces in a row(horizontally) they win the game.

            <p>
                If the game pieces are diagonally placed they also win.
                <br>
                Whether right to left,
